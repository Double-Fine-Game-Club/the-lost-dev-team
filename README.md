# The Lost Dev Team

# Concept
The Lost Dev Team is a puzzle platformer in which three game developers must escape a series of game prototypes.

# Resources
The relevant forum is [here](https://forums.doublefine.com/forum/81-the-lost-dev-team/) , and there is additional information to be found in this repo's issue tracker.

# Communication
Coordination and decision making will generally happen via IRC in the #amnesia-fortnight-community ([webchat](http://mibbit.com/?channel=#DFAF&server=irc.foonetic.net)) IRC channel on foonetic.net.

# Contributing
This repository is specifically for the game's code and game-ready assets, which should be contributed as "pull requests". Asset sources should be contributed to [this repository](https://github.com/Double-Fine-Game-Club/forum-downtime-funtime-adventure-assets) instead.

We have an open contribution policy for this project, allowing anybody to contribute anything they feel comfortable contributing. We'll try to include all contributions and allow for switching between any conflicting assets.
